## Solved
- 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists [Easy]
- 2. Add Two Numbers [Medium]
- Google foobar Challenge[Medium-Hard]
- 71. Simplify Path [Medium]
- 270. Closest Binary Search Tree Value[Easy]

###  2. Add Two Numbers
#### Elementary Math(Only approach)
- Basically you do walk through the ll and add node 1 and node two like you would with real numbers. But sinces its reversed you do left to right not right ot left



### 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
#### Iterative Where you walk through both lists and then sort those values after sorting you create a new list of all those values in the order you sorted
#### Recursively merge lists and place nodes in their place(BETTER SOLUTION)

### Google foobar Challenge
#### Nested loops to check how many employees cross


### 71. Simplify Path
#### basic filter where you go through and filter out each cat that doesn't belong in our string
#### Using a stack


### 270. Closest Binary Search Tree Value
#### GO through and calculate the min diff and the closest val for each node and return the value that is closest

## January Second

### Google Foobar Bomb Baby
### 503. Next Greater Element II
#### double the array and for each element in nums check for the next greater element in that double
#### Stack solution is o(n)


### 1379. Find a Corresponding Node of a Binary Tree in a Clone of That Tree
#### Approach one is basic BFS
