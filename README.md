## Leetcode Problem 700
- Difficulty::Easy
- Duration::10 minutes
- Interview Question Type:: Tree
- What did I do well?:: I identified the proper traversal method and implemented it in good time.
- What do I need to improve?::I did not go over time complexity analysis or space complexity while solving the problem
- Intuitive Takeaways::I didn't truly understand subtrees until this problem. I found that each node is just one location at the tree 
- Notes:: I need to better understand time complexity where recursion is concerned

## Leetcode Problem 83
- Difficulty::Easy
- Duration::12 minutes
- Interview Question Type::Linked List
- What did I do well?::Broke down the problem into small steps
- What do I need to improve?:: Make sure I read the entire question so i can get a deep understanding of the problem
- Intuitive Takeaways::to delete nodes in a linked list just skip nodes current.next = current.next.next
- Notes:: This solution only deletes adjacent duplicates. Thats all the problem asks for but if you wanted to delete all duplicates you could use a set to keep track of all the nodes you have seen and see that info in constant time with less space complextiy than if you used an object/hashtable

## Leetcode Problem 82
- Difficulty:: Medium
- Duration:: 40 minutes
- Interview Question Type:: Linked list two pointer solution
- What did I do well?::Understood the qustion 
- What do I need to improve?:: Learn more about heads and tails of lists
- Intuitive Takeaways:: edge cases are always involved in linked list problems
- Notes:: Dummy lists are usefulx
