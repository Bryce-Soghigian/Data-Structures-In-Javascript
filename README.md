# 11/10/2020
## Leetcode Problem 700
- Difficulty::Easy
- Duration::10 minutes
- Interview Question Type:: Tree
- What did I do well?:: I identified the proper traversal method and implemented it in good time.
- What do I need to improve?::I did not go over time complexity analysis or space complexity while solving the problem
- Intuitive Takeaways::I didn't truly understand subtrees until this problem. I found that each node is just one location at the tree 
- Notes:: I need to better understand time complexity where recursion is concerned

## Leetcode Problem 83
- Difficulty::Easy
- Duration::12 minutes
- Interview Question Type::Linked List
- What did I do well?::Broke down the problem into small steps
- What do I need to improve?:: Make sure I read the entire question so i can get a deep understanding of the problem
- Intuitive Takeaways::to delete nodes in a linked list just skip nodes current.next = current.next.next
- Notes:: This solution only deletes adjacent duplicates. Thats all the problem asks for but if you wanted to delete all duplicates you could use a set to keep track of all the nodes you have seen and see that info in constant time with less space complextiy than if you used an object/hashtable

## Leetcode Problem 82
- Difficulty:: Medium
- Duration:: 40 minutes
- Interview Question Type:: Linked list two pointer solution
- What did I do well?::Understood the qustion 
- What do I need to improve?:: Learn more about heads and tails of lists
- Intuitive Takeaways:: edge cases are always involved in linked list problems
- Notes:: Dummy lists are useful

## AlgoExpert BubbleSort
- Difficulty::Easy
- Duration::5 minutes
- Interview Question Type::Sorting
- What did I do well?:: Understood algorithm
- What do I need to improve?:: Nowhere
- Intuitive Takeaways::Bubblesort is slow but a good basic algo if you want to build a very intutive algo and preformance isn't important
- Notes::


## AlgoExpert InsertionSort
- Difficulty::Easy

- Intuitive Takeaways:: nada
- Notes::

## HeapSort
- Difficulty::Hard
- Duration::45 minutes
- Interview Question Type::Heap/ sorting
- What did I do well?::Applying a max heap
- What do I need to improve?::Better understanding of heaps themselves
- Intuitive Takeaways::
- Notes::



# 11/18/2020

## Algoexpert FindClosestValueInBST
- Difficulty::Easy
- Duration::25 Minutes
- Interview Question Type::PostOrder DFS in binary tree
- What did I do well?::tree traversal
- What do I need to improve?::The algorithm part of find closest value
- Intuitive Takeaways::
- Notes::







# 11/20/2020

## Leetcode Problem 226
- Question Title:: Invert Binary Search Tree
- Difficulty:: Easy
- Duration::10 minutes
- Interview Question Type:: BST
- What did I do well?:: identifying what the problem is and how exactly i could solve it
- What do I need to improve?:: understanding time complexity of recursion
- Intuitive Takeaways::each subtree is stored in the tree.left and tree.right . So if you want to modify tree left or swap values you can just change the assignment in the tree
- Notes:: Popular Interview question nailed

## Leetcode Problem 1602
- Difficulty:: Medium
- Duration::60 minutes
- Interview Question Type::BFS Tree traversal problem
- What did I do well?::Identified i needed to use bfs
- What do I need to improve?:: my implementation of bfs
- Intuitive Takeaways:: Make sure to chck the type of what they want you to return in this case they wanted a tree node but in my first solution i returned jsut the value as a number




# 11/24/2020

## Leetcode Problem 219
- Difficulty::Easy
- Duration::23 minutes
- Interview Question Type:: Array/ Duplicate
- What did I do well?::Identifying a way to track duplicates
- What do I need to improve?:: Finding a more efficent way to check ajecent elements
- Intuitive Takeaways::Always think about if you are going out of bounds when going through an array



## Leetcode Sort Array
- Difficulty:: Medium
- Duration:: 1 minute
- Interview Question Type:: Sorting

## 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST
- Difficulty::Medium
- Duration::25 minutes
- Interview Question Type:: BST
- What did I do well?:: Developed an algorithm quickly
- What do I need to improve?:: THere is definitely a way to do this by just traversing the tree and accessing the kth to last left node via a bfs that would remove the need for sorting from my algorithm
- Intuitive Takeaways:: I feel i understand javascript .sort() at a much better level after this problem
- Notes::
